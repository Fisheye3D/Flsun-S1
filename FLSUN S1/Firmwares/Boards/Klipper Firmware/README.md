## INSTALLATION

- Copy firmware named `Robin_nano35.bin` to the root of an microSD card formatted in FAT32 and an allocation size of 4096.
  
  **Note:** Use a small size like 128MB or 256MB for microSD because motherboard do not support microSD with large capacity for flash.

- With the machine turned off, insert the microSD card into the microSD port of the motherboard then turn on the printer.

- Installation only takes a few seconds, to verify that the firmware has been successfully installed, the file on the microSD card must have been renamed to `ROBIN_NANO35.BIN.CUR`.
